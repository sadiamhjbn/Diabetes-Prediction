🔍 Exploring Machine Learning for Diabetes Prediction 📊

I recently had the opportunity to work on a fascinating project using machine learning to predict diabetes outcomes. 🤖💉

I started by splitting the dataset into training and testing data, employing stratified sampling to ensure a balanced representation of outcomes. This is a crucial step to build a robust model. 

Here are some highlights of the classifiers I experimented with and their test accuracies:

1. 📈 Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel: 
   - Training Accuracy: 78.66%
   - Test Accuracy: 77.27%

2. 📊 k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) with k=3:
   - Training Accuracy: 86.48%
   - Test Accuracy: 69.48%

3. 📉 Gaussian Naive Bayes:
   - Training Accuracy: 75.57%
   - Test Accuracy: 77.27%

4. 🌳 Decision Tree Classifier with max depth=4:
   - Training Accuracy: 79.80%
   - Test Accuracy: 74.68%

5. 🌿 Random Forest Classifier with max depth=4:
   - Training Accuracy: 82.41%
   - Test Accuracy: 74.68%

6. 📊 Logistic Regression:
   - Training Accuracy: 78.50%
   - Test Accuracy: 75.97%

Each of these classifiers offers unique advantages, and it's exciting to see how they perform on the same dataset. Machine learning in healthcare can have a significant impact, and it's crucial to fine-tune models for the best outcomes.

The journey continues, with further optimizations and the exploration of additional models. I'm passionate about leveraging data science to make a difference, and I look forward to further developments in this area! 🚀📈
